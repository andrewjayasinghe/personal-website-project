        <h2>What will the website do?</h2>
        <h3>My plan is to create a website for a recreational fish breeding / export company. 
            This site will contain a portfolio of fish that the exporter breeds including a description and pictures.
            In addition to this, the site will contain a home, about, products and a Contact page. Each page will contain information relevant to their titles.
        </h3>

      <div class="myDiv">
        <h2>Who is the website for?</h2>
        <h3>The target audience for my website will be small to large businesses that are interested in recreational fish sales. These can include major stores such as pet smart or more localized vendors that import recreational fish from outside of their home countries.</h3>
